<h1>Building a Keylogger</h1>
<h2>Description</h2> <br>
A keylogger is a software or hardware tool created with the aim of discreetly recording and monitoring the keys pressed by a user on their computer or mobile device. These tools silently capture all keystrokes, which may encompass confidential information such as passwords, messages, and other text entries. Keyloggers have multiple uses, some of which can be harmful, including activities like stealing someone's identity, conducting espionage, or gaining unauthorized access to personal and financial accounts. This poses a considerable security risk, making it imperative for both individuals and organizations to employ measures to safeguard their devices and data from potential keylogger threats.
